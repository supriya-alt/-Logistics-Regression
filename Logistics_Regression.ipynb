        "\n",
        "-> Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique used to study the relationship between two variables — one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "It assumes that the relationship between X and Y is linear, meaning that a change in X leads to a proportional change in Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model is represented by the equation:\n",

        "𝑌=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋+𝜀\n",

        "\n",
        "where,\n",

        "ε = error term (difference between actual and predicted values)\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "The main purpose of SLR is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable and to understand the strength and direction of their relationship.\n",
        "For example, predicting a house’s price (Y) based on its area (X).\n",

        "#Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is based on several key assumptions to ensure the model’s validity and accuracy. These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "#Linearity:\n",
        "There is a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "\n",
        "#Independence:\n",
        "The residuals (errors) are independent of each other — no correlation among them.\n",

        "The variance of residuals is constant across all levels of X (no heteroscedasticity).\n",
        "\n",
        "#Normality of Errors:\n",
        "The residuals should be normally distributed around zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "#No or Minimal Multicollinearity:\n",
        "Since SLR involves only one predictor, this assumption is automatically satisfied, but it’s important in multiple regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "#No Autocorrelation:\n",
        "Particularly in time series data, residuals should not be correlated over time.\n",

        "\n",
        "For instance, a real estate company wants to estimate the price of a house (Y) using its built-up area in square feet (X).\n",
        "As the area of the house increases, the price generally increases in a linear pattern.\n",

        "as closely as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Question 6: What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Logistic Regression is a statistical method used to predict categorical outcomes, especially binary outcomes (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1, Pass/Fail).\n",
        "Instead of fitting a straight line, it models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category using the logistic (sigmoid) function.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Difference between Linear and Logistic Regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression lies in the type of problem they solve. Linear Regression is used for regression problems, where the target variable is continuous, such as predicting house prices, sales amounts, or student scores. In contrast, Logistic Regression is used for classification problems, where the target variable is categorical, such as predicting whether an email is spam or not, or whether a patient has a disease (Yes/No).\n",
        "\n",
        "Another difference is in the equation used. Linear Regression follows the equation\n",
        "𝑌=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋\n",
        "\n",
        "X, which gives output values that can range from negative to positive infinity. Logistic Regression, on the other hand, uses the sigmoid function to limit the output between 0 and 1, making it suitable for probability-based predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Regression models a straight-line relationship between the dependent and independent variables, assuming the relationship is linear. Logistic Regression does not assume a linear relationship between X and Y directly; instead, it models a non-linear S-shaped (sigmoid) curve through the log-odds of the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Linear Regression is mainly used when we are interested in predicting numeric outcomes, while Logistic Regression is used when we want to predict class membership or probability of a certain event occurring.\n",

        "R² measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model.\n",
        "Its value ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better model fit.\n",
        "An R² of 1 means the model perfectly predicts the data.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "For example, an R² value of 0.85 means that 85% of the variation in the target variable can be explained by the model, while the remaining 15% is due to other factors or random noise.\n",
